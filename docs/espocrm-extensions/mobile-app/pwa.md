# Progressive Web App (PWA) Overview

The Progressive Web App (PWA) feature in the Mobile App extension for EspoCRM enhances user experience by enabling the
application to function as a native-like app on supported devices. PWAs offer a seamless, reliable, and fast experience,
providing users with the ability to access EspoCRM even when offline.

## What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application that utilizes modern web technologies to provide a native
app-like experience to users. PWAs offer features such as offline access, push notifications, and device hardware
access, all while being accessible through a web browser. They provide a responsive and engaging user experience,
similar to that of native mobile apps.
