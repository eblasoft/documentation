### Row Coloring Based on Enum Field

Automatically color List View rows based on the selected Enum field values.

This feature allows administrators to choose a specific Enum field from the entity settings. The List View rows will then be dynamically colored according to the colors defined for the options of that Enum field.

**Configuration** : 

In the Entity Settings, select an Enum field to be used as the row color source.

**Behavior** :

Each row in the List View inherits the color of the selected Enum option value for that record.

**Consistency** :

Uses the same color definitions applied across Enum fields, ensuring a unified visual experience.

**Use Case** :

Quickly identify record status, priority, or category directly from the List View without opening records.
