***2. Responsive Design:*** The layout manager supports different panel and cell column sizes based on screen sizes. These sizes include **"xs"** for phones (screens < 768px wide), **"sm"** for tablets (screens >= 768px wide), **"md"** for small laptops (screens >= 992px wide), and **"lg"** for laptops and desktops (screens >= 1200px wide).

***3. 12-Column Grid:*** The layout manager supports a 12-column grid, allowing for more flexible panel and cell arrangements compared to the standard 4-column grid used in the "espo" CRM when using the **Grid** layout type.

Variable Cell Sizes:*** Unlike the standard EspoCRM, extension supports different cell sizes within the grid layout, providing more flexibility in arranging and sizing the panels.

***5. Wide Views:*** The layout manager introduces option called **"isWide"** that allows for a full-width detail layout (It can be set globally or on a per-view basis). This option allows for swapping the side panel to the bottom, enabling a wider and more expansive view.
